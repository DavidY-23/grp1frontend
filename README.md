To check you have installed node je correcty run the following command in your terminal to check the version of node js that you have installed: (node -v)

If the command above does not work then you have not installed it correctly.

2) Clone the repo from github (need collaborator access since this repo is private)

3) Open the repo in a text editor (we prefer VS code) and open a terminal and cd into the project repo that you cloned from github in the terminal.

4) type (npm i) in the terminal and then press enter to download the node modles and dependencies that the project needs.

5) finally type (npm start) in the terminal and then press enter to run the project.
