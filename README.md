# Diet UnQuiet
Diet UnQuiet is a website created from React. It is a project that 7 undergraduate students wanted to create for their capstone class.
The purpose of Diet Unquiet is to be a dieting app that offers the user a creative, and efficient way to lose weight. The app is constructed to offer the users a variety of options and approaches when it comes to losing weight, and staying healthy.

# On your Local Machine
Instructions on how to clone and run the repo on your local machine. 
1) On your computer you need to [download node js and npm](https://kinsta.com/blog/how-to-install-node-js/), doesn't matter what Operating System you have.

To check you have installed node js correctly run the following command in your terminal to check the version of node js that you have installed: ```node -v``` or ```npm -v```

If the command above does not work then you have not installed it correctly.

2) Clone the repo from github (need collaborator access since this repo is private)

3) Open the repo in a text editor (we prefer VS code) and open a terminal and cd into the project repo that you cloned from github in the terminal.

4) Type ```npm i``` in the terminal and then press enter to download the node modules and dependencies that the project needs.

5) Finally, type ```npm start``` in the terminal and then press enter to run the project.
